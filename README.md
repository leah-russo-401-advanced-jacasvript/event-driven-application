## Application Overview:

- CAPS Phase 1: Begin the build of an application for a company called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, weâ€™ll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, be notified that their customers received what they purchased.

- phase 3 Requirements:
As a vendor, I want to alert the system when I have a package to be picked up
As a driver, I want to be notified when there is a package to be delivered
As a driver, I want to alert the system when I have picked up a package and it is in transit
As a driver, I want to alert the system when a package has been delivered
As a vendor, I want to be notified when my package has been delivered
